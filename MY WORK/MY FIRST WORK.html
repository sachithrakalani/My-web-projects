                        <p>An article is any member of a class of dedicated 
                            words that are used in noun phrases to mark the 
                            identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. 
                            The category of articles constitutes a part of speech. 
                            In English, both "the" and "a(n)" are articles, which 
                            combine with nouns to form noun phrases.

                                <p>Basin research involves the practical realization 
                                    of the scale structure and the analysis of the 
                                    results according to the studied models and working frequency. 
                                    The obtained measurements are close in value to those of 
                                    the numerical simulations, this confirming the numerical 
                                    results obtained with Ansys Fluent.<br><br>

                                    The analysis carried out on the non-conventional naval 
                                    propulsion includes all the calculation elements to be 
                                    able to expand the understanding of this type of propulsion 
                                    to be able to find the most suitable ones for use in the 
                                    naval field and not only.<br><br>
                                    
                                    The research carried out in this paper presents numerous 
                                    elements of analysis of the unconventional naval propulsion system. 
                                    By plotting and validating the thrust functions for a blade, a complete 
                                    analysis of how this propulsion works is achieved.<br>

                                <p>Artical is a misspelled word of the word Article. It is not a correct word. 
                                    Many times because of the pronunciation of a word, the spelling of the word 
                                    seems different. There are many letters that are silent in the words and the 
                                    word sounds different altogether. And thus Artical is spelled this way because 
                                    of the pronunciation, which gives an incorrect spelling. The pronunciation of 
                                    it sounds like an artical, though the correct spelling is Article.<br><br>

                                    Have you seen Friends? It is the best comedy series of all time. 
                                    If you have you will relate to this, “That’s not even a word”. 
                                    Remember Monica saying it in the Season 4 episode “The One With The Embryos”. 
                                    Similarly, Artical, it is not even a word. If haven’t, watch this particular segment.<br><br>
                            
                                    Since the word Artical is not a word, it doesn’t have any meaning as well. 
                                    Since the spelling is wrong there will be no meaning. Google is the most 
                                    used search engine, it is reliable and it also shows no meaning at all as well, 
                                    of this word. You can try yourself, when you will try to find the meaning of the 
                                    word Artical it will automatically show you the results for the word Article, 
                                    since it’s the correct word.</p>
